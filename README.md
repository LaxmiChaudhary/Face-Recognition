# Face-Recognition
# Problem Statement
Goal is to build a face identification model to recognize faces.
# Description
The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces. In this project, we have used a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to recognize similar faces. Here, we are recognizing whether two given faces are of the same person or not. We have used Aligned Face Dataset from Pinterest. We have used to PCA to reduce the dimensionality and SVM classifier to map each image to the right person.
